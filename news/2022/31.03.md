## SVG Framework and icon components updated

SVG framework and icon components have been updated!

This release includes the following changes:

-   Replaced code that used [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) introduced in previous update. Unfortunately some developers still use outdated build tools that cannot parse modern JavaScript, mostly Vue 2 developers.
-   Replaced unnecessary complex function that validated icon sets with a simpler function. This change resulted in smaller bundle size for all icon components. Difference is about 5% - 8%, depending on component.
