## Update for Sketch plug-in

New version of Iconify plug-in for Sketch has been published.

This update cleans up animations in icons before importing, allowing icons that use SVG animations to be imported to Sketch.

Download is [available on GitHub repository for plug-in](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-sketch/releases/tag/2.0.7).
