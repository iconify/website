## Update for multiple packages {#update-11}

New minor versions of several Iconify packages have been published:

- [Iconify Utils](/docs/libraries/utils/index.md)
- [Iconify plugin for Tailwind CSS](/docs/usage/css/tailwind/tailwind4/index.md)
- [Iconify API](/docs/api/hosting.md)

as well as yesterday's release of new major version of [Iconify Tools](/docs/libraries/tools/index.md).

Goal of all those releases is the same: reduce number of dependencies.
These releases in some cases reduced number of dependencies to less than half of what it used to be.

Today, when developers and NPM packages are becoming targets of malicious attacks, it is more important than ever to stop relying on unnecessary and outdated dependencies.

All packages behave the same as before, changes are only internal.
