## Iconify Unplugin {#unplugin}

Announcing a new way of rendering icons: [Iconify Unplugin](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-unplugin).

What makes it different?

- Unlike other solutions, it splits icons in [SVG + CSS](/docs/usage/svg-css/). This massively reduces HTML size, while still rendering full SVG.
- Unlike icons on demand, Unplugin Iconify generates icons at build stage, so icons are bundled and rendered instantly.
- Instead of pre-built icon components, components are generated on demand, allowing you to customise components.
- Supports multiple frameworks. Current it supports only Vue, Svelte, React and Preact. More will be added soon.

See [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-unplugin).

Short graph of how it works:

Documentation is not ready yet, see readme file in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-unplugin).

If you have used Unplugin Icons package, which Iconify Unplugin is heavily inspired by, [Unplugin Icons documentation](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-icons) might be useful. Usage is very similar.
