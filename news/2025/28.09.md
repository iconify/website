## Fallback components for SVG + CSS {#css-vue-fallback}

For most use cases, [SVG + CSS](/docs/usage/svg-css/index.md) is an optimal way of rendering icons.

However, currently the latest version of Safari browser does not support it.

That means a fallback is required to render icons as full SVG without CSS for Safari users.

Fallback components have been created for the following frameworks:

- Vue: `[npm]@iconify/css-vue`.
- Svelte: `[npm]@iconify/css-svelte`.
- React: `[npm]@iconify/css-react`.

For now, only Vue version is marked as stable because it has been fully tested in production.

React and Svelte components should be stable because they share code base with Vue component,
but because icon components that rely on those components are not available yet, these two
components have no real use yet and cannot be fully tested.
