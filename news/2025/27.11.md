## Iconify Tools update {#tools-5}

New major version of [Iconify Tools](/docs/libraries/tools/index.md) has been published.

Changes:

- Drops support for CommonJS.
- Reduces number of dependencies and size of dependencies.
- Uses new custom parser for XML.

### CommonJS support

The biggest change is removal of CommonJS support.

Many dependencies no longer support CommonJS,
making it impossible to update those dependencies while providing CommonJS support.
To keep everything up to date, new version also removes CommonJS support.

If for some reason you still need CommonJS, install version 4:

```sh
npm install @iconify/tools@cjs --save
```

### New XML parser

SVG is now parsed by custom parser, which is much smaller than old parser.

That massively reduces bundle size and number of dependencies.

### Migration

There is nothing to do. Old code should work fine with new version.
