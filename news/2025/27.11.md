## Figma update {#figma-api}

Iconify icon sets are updated from multiple sources, but mostly from Git repositories and Figma documents.

Unfortunately, updating from Figma documents is no longer possible.

Figma has introduced heavy rate limiting for API queries, making it impossible to retrieve documents with many SVGs from Figma API.

### Affected icon sets

How does this affect Iconify?

This will affect updates of existing icon sets that are retrieved from Figma - those icon sets will no longer be maintained.
