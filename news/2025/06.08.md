## No more CommonJS support {#cjs-utils}

New major versions of [Iconify Utils](/docs/libraries/utils/index.md) have been published.

This release includes only one change: removal of CommonJS support.

More and more NPM packages remove CommonJS support.
I tried to keep supporting both CJS and ESM for as long as possible, but some dependencies used by Iconify Utils package
no longer support CommonJS, so it is time for a choice: keep outdated dependencies or remove CommonJS support.

In modern development there is no place for CommonJS. It is a relic of the past.

If your build process requires CommonJS support, I urge you to update your code.

If you can't update, you can still use version 2 of Iconify Utils. You can install old version using:

```sh
npm install @iconify/utils@cjs
```
