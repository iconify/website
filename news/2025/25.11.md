## Iconify Tools removes axios {#tools-axios}

Usually only major updates are posted here, but this one can potentially be breaking for some users.

[Iconify Tools](/docs/libraries/tools/index.md) package has been updated,
which includes mostly just updates to dependencies and minor fixes,
but there is one change that could be breaking: removal of axios as dependency.

If you need to use axios for some reason, you can set it with new `[func]setFetch()` function:

```js
import axios from "axios";
import { setFetch } from "@iconify/tools";

const fetchAxios = axios.create({
  adapter: "fetch",
});

setFetch(fetchAxios);
```
