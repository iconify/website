## Update for Icon component for Svelte {#svelte-update}

New minor version of [Iconify icon component for Svelte](/docs/icon-components/svelte/index.md) has been published.

This update fixes issue that triggered `[str]effect_update_depth_exceeded` error in Svelte when using many icons (over 5k icons) on same page.

This also slightly changes component behavior. Now icon is rendered immediately, without waiting for component to mount, which might cause hydration warnings when using component with SvelteKit.

Additionally, `[prop]ssr` property has been removed because it is no longer used.
