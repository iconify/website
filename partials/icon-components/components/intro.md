Iconify offers native icon components for several popular UI frameworks.

Iconify for React is one of such components.

Yet another icon component? What are the advantages over other icon components?

- One syntax for over 60,000 icons from 80+ icon sets.
- Renders SVG. Many components simply render icon fonts, which look ugly. Iconify uses only pixel perfect SVG.
- Loads icons on demand. No need to bundle icons, component will automatically load icon data for icons that you use from Iconify API.
